Instrument Manager Test Plan

1. User has access to Instrument Manager if he/she has permission “superuser”.
2. Check that tab exists on a default install (for superusers).
3. Check that the warning text above is accurate for both with and without the directory writeable by Apache. The select file/upload button shouuld only be there if it's writeable.
4. Verify GUI is updated, menu tabs are working.
5. Check that instrument gets installed properly. Also check the paths in the code - eg uploaded instruments in the instruments directory with right permissions.
6. Check generate_tables_sql_and_testNames.php was performed on the instrument and output(instrument_subtests, test_names, instrument table itself) was generated correctly.
7. Check that instruments' metadata in the table are labeled accurately.
8. Check that function CheckTable performs the appropriate checks on the instrument builder files and validates them properly - eg "Table Valid" column is valid when instrument fields match up and "Pages Valid" is valid when subpages are valid.
